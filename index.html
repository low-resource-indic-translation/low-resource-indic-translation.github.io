<H3>TASK DESCRIPTION</H3>

<p> Machine translation (MT) performance has improved significantly in the past few years Within the MT and NLP communities, 
  English is by far the most resource-rich language. MT systems are most often trained to translate texts from and to English, or 
  they use English as a source or target language to translate low-resource languages.
  However, MT coverage for more users speaking diverse languages is limited because the MT methods demand vast amounts of parallel data to 
  train quality systems, which has posed a significant obstacle for low-resource translation. 
  Therefore, developing MT systems with relatively small parallel datasets is still highly desirable in this shared task for 
  the English-Assamese, English-Mizo, and English-Khasi language pairs. The main challenge here is how to efficiently utilize 
  monolingual data or techniques such as multilingual, transfer learning, or language model to improve translation performance for 
  English-to-Assamese/Mizo/Khasi and Assamese/Mizo/Khasi-to-English. The evaluation will be carried out using automatic evaluation metrics 
  (BLEU, TER, RIBES) and human evaluation. 
     
<H4>Language Pairs</H4>

We focus on the following language pairs (both direction for each):
          
          <ul>
          <li> en-as: English ↔ Assamese</li>
          <li> en-mz: English ↔ Mizo</li>
          <li> en-kha: English ↔ Khasi</li>
          <li> en-mn: English ↔ Manipuri</li>
          </ul>
 <H4>There will be four subtasks:</H4>
  <ul>
          <li> Subtask-1: English ⇿ Assamese (English-to-Assamese and Assamese-to-English Machine Translation)</li>
          <li> Subtask-2: English ⇿ Mizo (English-to-Mizo and Mizo-to-English Machine Translation) </li>
          <li> Subtask-3: English ⇿ Khasi (English-to-Khasi and Khasi-to-English Machine Translation)
          <li> Subtask-4: English ⇿ Manipuri (English-to-Manipuri and Khasi-to-Manipuri Machine Translation)

      </li>
  </ul>
<H4>Utilizing parallel data</H4>

No additional parallel data is allowed for training. Constrained submissions only.

<H4>Utilizing monolingual data</H4>

You are encouraged to develop novel solutions to utilize monolingual corpora to improve translation quality.

<H3>DATA</H3>

<p>Train/Dev/Test data are available <a href="XXX">here</a>.  
  
<p><b>To participate, please register using this <a href="https://forms.google">form</a>. The dataset password is displayed when you complete the form.</b>
  
<H3>SUBMISSIONS</H3>

<p>The test data is available at the same repository as the training data <a href="xxx">here</a> and it can be accessed using the same password sent via e-mail.

You are allowed to submit 1 CONSTRAINT, 1 PRIMARY and up to 2 CONTRASTIVE systems for each language pair/translation direction.
     
<p>You should submit your results by TBA, 2023 (anywhere in the world) in a zip file to wmt.similarlanguagetranslation(at)gmail.com. Your zip file should contain your submission files and a brief description of your approach(es) as follows:

<H3>EVALUATION</H3>
  
<p>The evaluation was carried out automatically using BLEU (Papieni et al., 2002) and TER (Snover et al., 2006), and RIBES (Isozaki et al., 2010). 

<p>Here you can find the results of the <a href="XXX">English - Assamese</a> tracks ranked by BLEU score. 
<p>Here you can find the results of the <a href="XXX">English - Mizo </a> tracks ranked by BLEU score.
<p>Here you can find the results of the <a href="XXX">English - Khasi </a> tracks ranked by BLEU score.
<p>Here you can find the results of the <a href="XXX">English - Manipuri </a> tracks ranked by BLEU score.

<H3>Paper Submission</H3>
 
 <p>Your system paper submission should be prepared according to the <a href="http://www.statmt.org/wmt23/index.html">WMT instructions</a> and uploaded to START before August 5, 2021.
